Summary for Heap Sort:
Heap Sort was the most consistent in performance compared to Quick sort and Merge Sort across different input types, especially for sorted and reverse-sorted arrays,due to its O(n log n) time complexity in every case. However, it was generally slower than Quick Sort for random input, likely due to less cache-efficient operations.

Summary for Priority Queue:
A Priority Queue is a data structure that allows elements to be processed based on their priority, rather than the order they were added. It is typically implemented using a binary heap, either as a max-heap or min-heap. In a max-heap, the element with the highest priority is always at the root, while in a min-heap, the element with the lowest priority is at the root. This structure allows for efficient access, insertion, and removal of elements based on priority.
