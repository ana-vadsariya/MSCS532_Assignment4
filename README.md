Summary for Heap Sort:
Heap Sort was the most consistent in performance compared to Quick sort and Merge Sort across different input types, especially for sorted and reverse-sorted arrays,due to its O(n log n) time complexity in every case. However, it was generally slower than Quick Sort for random input, likely due to less cache-efficient operations.
